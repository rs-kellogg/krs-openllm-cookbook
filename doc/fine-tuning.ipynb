    "<font color='purple'>__Fine-tuning__</font> is a supervised learning process that uses a data set of labeled examples to update the weights of an LLM. The labeled examples or prompt-completion pairs are used to improve the LLM's ability to generate good completions for a specific task."

    "<font color='purple'>__Fine-tuning__</font> takes LLMs beyond basic prompting by allowing you to train a model on a larger dataset specifically tailored to your desired task, leading to several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ___Superior Results___: Compared to prompting, fine-tuning delivers higher quality outputs because the model learns directly from a wider range of examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ___Efficiency___: You can train on more data than can fit in a single prompt, saving on token usage and reducing latency for requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ___Specificity___: Fine-tuning excels at tasks requiring specific styles, tones, formats, or consistent outputs. It enhances reliability in achieving your desired results, handles complex instructions better, and tackles edge cases effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ___New Skills___: Fine-tuning empowers the model to master new skills or complete tasks that are difficult to articulate through simple prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### __What you need__\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='purple'>__Fine-tuning__</font> is a __time-intensive__ process that requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "__1.) <font color='purple'>a ground-truth dataset__</font> -  This is a comprehensive and high-quality dataset that the model can learn from. It should be representative of the problem space and contain examples of the types of tasks you want the model to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2.) <font color='purple'>intricate code__</font> - Fine-tuning a model is not a straightforward process. It requires intricate, carefully crafted code that can effectively guide the model's learning process. This includes setting up the learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and other hyperparameters, as well as implementing the training loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "__3.) <font color='purple'>iteration__</font> - Fine-tuning an LLM is rarely a \"one and done\" task. It often involves multiple iterations of training, evaluation, and refinement. After each round of training, the model's performance should be evaluated using a separate validation dataset. Based on the results, adjustments may need to be made to the model architecture, hyperparameters, or training data. This iterative process continues until the model's performance meets the desired criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### __When to use it__\n",
    "\n",
    "Before delving into the mechanics of fine-tuning; note that it might not always be the best solution.  Here's a breakdown of when to apply prompt-engineering, RAG, or fine-tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='purple'>_Use Prompt Engineering for_</font>:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Achieving good results for simpler tasks without extensive training data. You can improve prompts with: \n",
    "    * <font color='purple'>__Few-shot in-context learning__</font> - providing examples of respsonses within the prompt\n",
    "    * <font color='purple'>__Prompt chaining__</font> - breaking down complex tasks into smaller, sequential prompts for the model to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='purple'>_Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for_</font>:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Situations with a large, relevant document database.\n",
    "* Tasks requiring factual accuracy where context retrieval is beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color='purple'>_Use Fine-Tuning for_</font>:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tasks requiring consistent outputs in a particular style, tone, or format.\n",
    "* Achieving specific behaviors from the model.\n",
    "* Mastering complex tasks that are difficult to express through simple prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "Our advice is to experiment with crafting effective instructions and prompts for the model before attempting fine-tuning. Prompt engineering is low-cost and does not require any programming. Different prompting techniques can be used, such as few-shot in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompts. Fine-tuning requires more effort -- it requires a collection of supervised training examples, some programming work, extra GPU resources, and extra storage for a model with updated weights.\n",

This approach allows the model to fully adapt to the new task, potentially leading to higher performance. However, it requires a large amount of data and computational resources, and there's a risk of __catastrophic forgetting__ (the model could forget to do tasks it could before.)\n",

This strategy requires less memory and computational resources to perform, making it a more efficient choice in certain scenarios. By only updating a portion of the model, it may not be as effective when the model needs to significantly alter its initial learning or \"forget\" tasks it initially performed poorly. Two of the most effective PEFT methods are:\n",
    "\n",

    "    * __Additive__ - freezes all the original LLM weights while adding trainable layers or paramters to the model. One example is called __prompt tuning__ that freezes model weights, but adds trainable tokens (__soft prompts__) to the prompt embeddings.  This only updates the prompt weights. \n",
