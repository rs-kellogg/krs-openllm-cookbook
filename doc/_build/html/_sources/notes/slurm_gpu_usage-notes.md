# Using GPUs at Northwestern

Now we're going to discuss how you execute a model on on-premise resources, particularly on GPUs. In order to use the code shown in this workshop, you will need to be a member of a Quest allocation. Most of you have been added to one for this workshop - "e32337". If you have not been (or don't know how to find out if you are, please let us know and we'll help you out. This allocation will be avaialble for several months for you to use.
