    "The purpose of running our LLMs on GPU nodes is primarily to speed up calculations and processing.  In order to understand this, you'll often hear us talk about <font color='purple'>CPUs</font>, <font color='purple'>GPUs</font>, and <font color='purple'>CUDA</font>.  This section breaks down these terms.\n",
    "\n",
    " Much like your own computer, some of our KLC and Quest nodes are equipped with both processors and graphics cards. A processor or <font color='purple'>central processing unit (CPU)</font> is responsible for all the mathematical and logical calculations on a node. In a nutshell it runs code. While CPUs are extremely powerful and complete most tasks in an infinitesimally short amount of time, it is important to note that a CPU core can only handle one task a a time and runs things sequentially."

    "One way to speed up processing is through parallel computing. Parallel computing is a method of solving a single problem by breaking it down into smaller chunks that can run simultaneously.  This is essentially taking a task and distributing it over multiple CPUs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, a graphics card or <font color='purple'>graphics processing unit (GPU)</font> is a specialized hardware component that can efficiently handle parallel mathematical operations. In comparison to the 24 cores you are entitled to use on KLC, a A100 GPU contains 6,912 <font color='purple'>CUDA</font> cores.  Whiel a CUDA core is less powerful than an individual CPU core, the sheer volume of them make them ideal for handling large amounts of computations in parallel. If GPUs are so much better at parallelization than CPUs, why aren't all tasks given to GPUs?  \n",
    "\n",
    "While parallelizing tasks often makes them run more quickly, it is important to note that some tasks actually take longer if parallelized.  For instance, searching a sorted list for a specific value.  If you take a list and divide it among multiple CPUs, each CPU will search a portion of that list for the given value. Once each individual CPU search is complete, the different cores then have to communicate and coordinate with one another to determine the final answer.  If the list is relatively small, the coordination across cores might actually take longer than having a single CPU core compelte the task alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "The potentially inefficiency of parallelization raises the question of how your system know when to send a task to CPUs or to GPUs? This is where CUDA comes in.  <font color='purple'>CUDA (compute unified device architecture)</font> is a powerful platform that helps computer programs run faster. We use it to solve performance intensitve problems. cuda is software but also embedded in hardware. CUDA allows you to switch between cpu processing and gpu processing for certain tasks. "
